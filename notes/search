To disable case folding (when you don't want automatic case sensitivity detection):
   M-x customize-option case-fold-search RET

C-w		Add word at point to search string
C-M-y		Add character at point to search string
M-s C-e		Add rest of line at point to search string
C-y		Yank (“paste”) from clipboard to search string

Changing current search behavior:
M-s c	 	Toggles case-sensitivity
M-s r		Toggles regular-expression mode
M-s w		Toggles word mode
M-s _		Toggles symbol mode (useful if you don't know or care if there is . or ->)
M-s <SPC>	Toggles lax whitespace matching

For grep-like search, check occur-mode note.
For searching by index entries added by specific modes check imenu note.
For more advanced stuff check helm
