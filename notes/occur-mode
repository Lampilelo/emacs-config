Occur mode (something like grep in current buffer):
      M-s o   	Occur mode
      M-s o	Activate occur on current search string inside Isearch
      
If you want to view lines before and after matching one you need to customize
   list-matching-lines-default-context-lines variable

	Occur mode keybindings:
	M-n , M-p	Go to next and previous occurrence
	< , >		Go to beginning and end of buffer
	g   		Revert the buffer, refreshing the search results
	q		Quits occur mode
	e		Switches to occur edit mode
	C-c C-c		Exits occur edit mode and applies changse

	M-g M-n	    Jump to next “error”
	M-g M-p	    Jump to previous “error”
	# Note: it's called an error because its main purpose is to cycle
	#       through compile errors, but it works in the occur buffer
	
	Multi-occur:
	M-x multi-occur				For on multiple buffers
	M-x multi-occur-in-matching-buffers	Matches buffers by regexp
